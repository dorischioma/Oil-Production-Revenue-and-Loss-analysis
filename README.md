# Oil-Production-Revenue-and-Loss-analysis

## Project Overview:
Nigeria’s oil industry is the backbone of its economy. For decades, oil has fueled government budgets, international trade, and infrastructure development. But behind the numbers lies a hidden crisis, one that is costing the country billions of dollars every year.

Oil theft, pipeline vandalism, and severe production losses have turned what should be a thriving sector into a battleground of inefficiencies and lost potential. Despite efforts to curb the issue, thousands of barrels of oil vanish daily, affecting national revenue, investor confidence, and economic stability.

This report dives into the extent of these losses, revealing the trends, key players, and hidden gaps in Nigeria’s oil production system. It also presents data-driven recommendations to close these gaps and improve oil sector performance.

## Problem Statement:
Theft and pipeline vandalism have long been major threats to Nigeria’s oil industry. But the problem goes beyond criminal activities, many losses stem from measurement errors, operational inefficiencies, and reporting discrepancies that create significant financial leaks.

## Key Questions:
### Production Loss and Revenue Trends by Year
- How has oil production changed between 2022 and 2023?
- How has fiscalized production changed, and what does this mean for revenue?
- How much oil was lost to theft in 2023 compared to 2022?
- How has total revenue trended from 1994 to 2024?
### Oil Loss Breakdown by Producers
- Which oil companies experience the highest losses in production?
- How do revenue losses compare across different producers?
### Oil Loss causes
- What are the primary causes of production losses?
- Which producers have the highest theft losses?
### Fiscalized Production vs Revenue
- Which oil producers have the highest fiscalized production?
- How do fiscalized production and revenue estimates compare among producers?
- What is the relationship between fiscalized production and estimated revenue?
- Which producers have the largest gaps between production and revenue?
### Terminal Analysis
- Which terminal operators own the highest number of crude terminals?
- Which terminal operators have the highest error rates in production records?
- Which terminals are at the highest risk of oil theft?
- How does production vary across different crude terminals?

## Key Insights
### 1. Production Loss and Revenue Trend by Year
**Production is improving, but is it enough?**
At first glance, Nigeria’s oil production numbers show signs of improvement.
- In 2023, total metered production increased by 3.34% to 545.25M barrels, up from 527.64M barrels in 2022.
- More importantly, fiscalized production (the actual oil accounted for in revenue) rose by 9.5%, suggesting better efficiency in reporting and operations.
But a deeper look reveals a troubling pattern: fiscalized production remains significantly lower than metered production across all producers. The difference represents unaccounted for oil, oil that is either stolen, lost due to measurement errors, or unreported.
For example:
- NNPC 18 produced 3.28M barrels in 2023, but only 205K barrels were fiscalized. The missing 3M barrels, 94% of its production simply disappeared.
**Oil Theft saw a 75% Drop, but the fight isn't over**
The good news? Theft volume dropped sharply from 21.5M barrels in 2022 to just 5.25M barrels in 2022, a 75.16% decrease.
This suggests that improved security measures and stricter monitoring are working. But even with this decline, theft still cost the industry billions.

### 2. Oil Loss Breakdown by Producers
**Massive Losses for Some, Marginal Losses for Others**
Not all oil producers experience losses at the same rate. Some companies consistently report massive production gaps, while others have better control over their output.
- NNPC 18 (formerly Eroton) recorded the highest losses in 2022, with a staggering 94% of its production disappearing. This translated to a $310.9M revenue loss.
- Belema Oil Company followed with an 88% loss, costing $124.9M in revenue.
- Aiteo Eastern E&P (86% loss) and Heirs Energy (62% loss) also suffered devastating losses.
Yet, some producers have relatively lower losses:
- TotalEnergies E&P (29%) and Nigeria Agip Oil Company (25%) managed to retain more of their production.
- Esso Exploration and Mobil Producing had the smallest revenue gap (>1%), showing stronger production accountability.
This raises an important question: Why do some companies lose so much while others don’t?
The answer lies in theft rates, measurement errors, and operational efficiency.

### 3. Oil Loss causes
**Primary causes of production loss**
By analyzing 53 producers, we found that 21 producers reported zero losses—a sign that better security and measurement systems can make a difference.
But for the 29 producers who did experience losses, the causes varied:
- In 2022, theft accounted for over 90% of losses for most producers.
- Some companies, like Belema Oil, lost 95.29% of their production purely to theft.
- Others, like SPDC, suffered mainly from measurement errors (43.93% loss) rather than theft (36.86%).
By 2023, overall theft dropped, but measurement errors remained a persistent issue.
**Producers with the highest Theft Loss**
Some companies saw their theft volumes eat up nearly all of their production capacity:
- Seplat Energy lost 73.56% of its production to theft (1.8M barrels in 2023).
- NAOC lost 80.16% of its total production to theft.
- Belema, Newcross E&P, and Heirs Energy also ranked among the hardest hit.

In contrast, some terminals reported zero theft, proving that security investments do work.

### 4. Fiscalized Production vs Revenue
In 2022 and 2023, three oil giants: TotalEnergies Upstream, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, and Chevron Nigeria Limited, stood out as the top producers with the highest fiscalized volumes. Naturally, this translated to higher revenues.
But not every producer was so fortunate.
The Hard Truth is Some Producers Lost Almost Everything
For some companies, production numbers looked good on paper, until you saw how much of their oil was lost before it could be accounted for.
- NNPC 18 (formerly Eroton) suffered the worst revenue loss in 2022, with $310.9 million vanishing. Nearly 94% of its production was lost before reaching fiscalization.
- Belema Oil & Aiteo faced an even grimmer reality over 80% of their revenue potential disappeared.

The charts made this painfully clear: producers hit hardest by theft and measurement issues were marked in red, a visual reminder of the billions slipping away.
**More Fiscalized Production = More Revenue**
The pattern was undeniable, companies that successfully fiscalized most of their production enjoyed higher revenues. But theft, leaks, and accounting errors were massive obstacles.
If oil producers could recover even a fraction of these losses, it could mean billions of dollars in regained revenue—money that could boost economic stability, fund development, and improve investor confidence.

### 5. Terminal Analysis
**High theft risk terminals**
Certain oil terminals consistently report high theft rates, making them hotspots for illegal activity:
- Bonny Terminal lost 56.64% of its production to theft.
- Forcados Terminal followed with 23.5% losses.
- Brass, Escravos, and Bonny (OML 11) also ranked high in vulnerability.
However, not all terminals are at risk. Terminals operated by MPN, TotalEnergies, and SNEPCO reported zero theft.

## Recommendations
1. **Enhanced Security Measures at High Risk Terminals**: Between 2022-2023, 26.40M barrels of oil was lost to theft which was valued at approximately $213.4bn, with significant losses reported at the Bonny, Forcados amd Brass terminals. According to [Brand Spur](https://brandspurng.com/2019/09/19/shell-petroleum-commences-aerial-surveillance-to-reduce-pipeline-vandalism/), The deployment of aerial surveillance and advanced monitoring technologies has been identified as a strategic approach to combat pipeline vandalism and oil theft in Nigeria. 
2. **Improve Measurement Accuracy to Reduce Revenue Leakages**: In 2023, over 2.91M barrels of oil was lost to measurement error, highlighting significant discrepancies in production measurement. Implementing advanced metering infrastructure can significantly reduce measurement errors and unaccounted losses in oil production.​
3. **Strategic Theft Prevention**: In 2022, Nigeria lost about $2.13 billion to crude oil theft and related losses, underscoring the severity of the issue. Engaging local communities in surveillance and security efforts has proven effective in reducing pipeline vandalism and oil theft.

4. **Conduct Operational Audits to Optimize Production Efficiency**: Pipeline vandalism and oil theft have contributed to a 8.98% reduction in Nigeria's oil output between 2022-2023, emphasizing the need for operational audits and efficiency improvements. ​Regular operational audits and the implementation of best practices have been shown to enhance production efficiency in the oil and gas sector.​
5. **Strengthen Government Policy for Real-Time Reporting**: The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has highlighted significant losses due to crude oil theft and has called for strengthened regulations to ensure accurate reporting and transparency [neiti.gov.ng](https://neiti.gov.ng/cms/neiti-backs-fg-investigative-panel-on-oil-theft-calls-for-action-on-glencore-bribery-scandal/). Countries that have implemented stringent regulations and transparent reporting mechanisms have seen reductions in resource-related losses and improved accountability.​ For example: Ghana’s digital oil tracking system increased revenue by approximately $172M in March 2021 [businessghana.com](https://www.businessghana.com/site/news/general/236195/Digital-petroleum-monitoring-rakes-in-GHC1bn).
