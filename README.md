# Oil-Production-Revenue-and-Loss-analysis

## Project Overview:
Oil production and revenue are critical economic factors, yet theft and pipeline vandalism remain major challenges affecting national income. This project analyzes the impact of oil theft on production and revenue, identifying trends and patterns in oil theft incidents. The analysis incorporates financial, economic, security, and operational data to provide insights into how theft correlates with revenue losses and production shortages.

Using descriptive and diagnostic analysis, this study aims to support decision-making for key stakeholders, including oil companies, government agencies, and investors.



## Problem Statement:
Oil theft and pipeline vandalism have led to significant production losses, reduced fiscalized revenue, and increased security risks in the oil and gas industry. This issue affects national income and threatens economic stability. Despite existing measures, theft patterns continue to evolve making it critical to analyze their impact on production and revenue to develop effective mitigation strategies.

## Data Sources:
-	NEITI
-	EIA

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI

### Data cleaning
** Ensuring Accuracy and Consistency**
- Historical production and revenue data were pre-cleaned and well-organized.
- Brent crude oil price data was aggregated yearly.
- The 2022–2023 crude production dataset required:
  - Removal of unnecessary columns.
  - Handling of duplicates and missing values.
  - Data restructuring for improved analysis.
  - Standardization of text formatting.

## Key Insights
### 1. Production Loss and Revenue Trend by Year
- Metered production increased by 3.34% in 2023 (545.25M barrels) compared to 2022 (527.64M barrels).
- Fiscalized production rose by 9.5% in 2023 (537.57M barrels) compared to 2022 (490.94M barrels), indicating improved operational efficiency.
- Fiscalized production is consistently lower than metered production, indicating revenue-impacting losses.
- Shell production discrepancy: Shell produced 11.2M barrels but fiscalized only 2.0M barrels, an 82% loss.
- Oil theft volume dropped from 21.15M barrels (2022) to 5.25M barrels (2023), a 75.16% decrease, likely due to enhanced security measures.
- Long-term revenue trend:
   - Revenue grew from $6B in 1994 to $46B in 2011, followed by a decline to $36B in 2014.
   - Data gaps exist between 2015 and 2021.
   - Revenue peaked at $50B in 2022, then declined to $44B in 2023, highlighting oil price volatility.

### 2. Oil Loss Breakdown by Producers
- Highest production loss in 2022:
  - NNPC 18 (Eroton): 94% loss amounting to a $310.9M revenue loss
  - Belema Oil: 88% loss amounting to a $124.9M revenue loss
  - Aiteo Eastern E&P: 86% loss amounting to a $155.5M revenue loss
  - Heirs Energy: 62% loss amounting to a $267.6M revenue loss
- Highest revenue loss in 2022:
  - Shell (SPDC): $1.56B revenue loss despite a moderate 32% loss.

### 3. Oil Loss causes
- In 2022, 21 out of 53 producers recorded no production loss.
- Theft accounted for 90%+ of total losses for 29 producers.
- Producers heavily impacted by theft in 2022:
  - NNPC 18 (51.9% of total loss)
  - Belema Oil (95.29%)
  - SPDC (36.86%)
-------
### 4. Fiscalized Production vs Revenue
- Top producers with highest fiscalized production (2022–2023):
  - TotalEnergies Upstream
  - Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited
  - Chevron Nigeria Limited
- Revenue directly correlates with fiscalized production. Lower fiscalized production leads to a lower revenue.
- Some producers had high production and high revenue but were badly affected by theft and is indicated in the chart with 'red'.
- Producers with largest revenue loss in 2022:
  - NNPC 18: $310.9M loss
  - Belema Oil & Aiteo: 80%+ revenue loss
-------
### 5. Terminal Analysis
- Terminal operator with the most crude terminals: SPDC operates the most crude terminals (15 terminals).
- Highest production error rates: SPDC recorded the highest error (98.23%) 
- Highest-risk terminals for oil theft:
  - Bonny (56.64%)
  - Forcados (23.5%)
  - Brass (15.5%)
- Terminals with no theft incidents:

## Recommendations
1. **Enhanced Security Measures at High Risk Terminals**: Between 2022-2023, 26.40M barrels of oil was lost to theft which was valued at approximately $213.4bn, with significant losses reported at the Bonny, Forcados amd Brass terminals. According to [Brand Spur](https://brandspurng.com/2019/09/19/shell-petroleum-commences-aerial-surveillance-to-reduce-pipeline-vandalism/), The deployment of aerial surveillance and advanced monitoring technologies has been identified as a strategic approach to combat pipeline vandalism and oil theft in Nigeria. 
2. **Improve Measurement Accuracy to Reduce Revenue Leakages**: In 2023, over 2.91M barrels of oil was lost to measurement error, highlighting significant discrepancies in production measurement. Implementing advanced metering infrastructure can significantly reduce measurement errors and unaccounted losses in oil production.​
3. **Strategic Theft Prevention**: In 2022, Nigeria lost about $2.13 billion to crude oil theft and related losses, underscoring the severity of the issue. Engaging local communities in surveillance and security efforts has proven effective in reducing pipeline vandalism and oil theft.

4. **Conduct Operational Audits to Optimize Production Efficiency**: Pipeline vandalism and oil theft have contributed to a 8.98% reduction in Nigeria's oil output between 2022-2023, emphasizing the need for operational audits and efficiency improvements. ​Regular operational audits and the implementation of best practices have been shown to enhance production efficiency in the oil and gas sector.​
5. **Strengthen Government Policy for Real-Time Reporting**: The Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has highlighted significant losses due to crude oil theft and has called for strengthened regulations to ensure accurate reporting and transparency [neiti.gov.ng](https://neiti.gov.ng/cms/neiti-backs-fg-investigative-panel-on-oil-theft-calls-for-action-on-glencore-bribery-scandal/). Countries that have implemented stringent regulations and transparent reporting mechanisms have seen reductions in resource-related losses and improved accountability.​ For example: Ghana’s digital oil tracking system increased revenue by approximately $172M in March 2021 [businessghana.com](https://www.businessghana.com/site/news/general/236195/Digital-petroleum-monitoring-rakes-in-GHC1bn).
